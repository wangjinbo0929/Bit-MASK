To create bit mask images, execute the script BIT-MASK.m.

To generate images with different bit masks, follow these steps:

Open the BIT-MASK. m file.
Uncomment the code lines from 29 to 41 to produce images with bit masks ranging from 1-bit to 7-bit.  Each block of code corresponds to a specific bit mask as follows:

Line 29-30: Uncomment to generate a 1-bit mask image.
Line 31-32: Uncomment to generate a 2-bit mask image.
Line 33-34: Uncomment to generate a 3-bit mask image.
Line 35-36: Uncomment to generate a 4-bit mask image.
Line 37-38: Uncomment to generate a 5-bit mask image.
Line 39-40: Uncomment to generate a 6-bit mask image.
Line 41: Uncomment to generate a 7-bit mask image.

Make sure to comment out the other lines or only uncomment the line corresponding to the bit mask you wish to apply.  Running the script will then produce the desired bit mask image.
